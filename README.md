SysTrack: System Resource MonitorSysTrack is a real-time system resource monitoring application built with Python, CustomTkinter for the GUI, psutil for system metrics, and matplotlib for dynamic graphing. It provides a comprehensive overview of your system's performance, including CPU, RAM, GPU, Disk, and Network usage, as well as a list of top processes.‚ú® FeaturesReal-time Monitoring: Tracks key system metrics every second.Overview Tab:CPU, RAM, GPU, and Disk usage with color-coded progress bars (Green, Yellow, Red).Detailed information on CPU frequency, temperature, and GPU memory/temperature.Real-time Network Upload and Download speeds (auto-switching between KB/s and MB/s).FPS (Frames Per Second) measurement.Detailed Stats Tab:Live CPU Usage Graph showing history over the last 60 seconds.Per-Core CPU Usage visualization.Processes Tab:Table listing the Top 20 Processes sorted by CPU usage.Displays Process ID (PID), Name, CPU %, and Memory %.Alert System: Shows warning pop-ups if CPU, RAM, or GPU usage exceeds defined thresholds (default is 90%).Logging: Optional feature to log system stats to a CSV file (system_log.csv) for later analysis.‚öôÔ∏è Installation and SetupPrerequisitesPython 3.xStepsClone the repository:Bashgit clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
